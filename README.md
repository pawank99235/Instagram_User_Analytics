# Instagram_User_Analytics

In this project I’ll do a work of data analyst. We’ll 
analyze with user interactions and engagement with 
the Instagram app to provide valuable insights that can 
help business grow.
Also we’ll track how users engage with a digital product 
such as a software or a mobile application or a 
software application. 
Those things will help in many ways i.e the marketing 
team might use these insights to launch a new 
campaign, the product team might use them to decide 
on new features to build, and the development team 
might use them to improve the overall experience.
In this project I’ll be using MySQL to analyze Instagram 
data and my insights will help the product manager 
and rest of the team to make decisions about the 
future features on the Instagram app
